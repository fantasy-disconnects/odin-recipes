    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You will die before you taste anything better than naan. It is the tortilla's great-great-great-great-great-great
        grandparent but way better because it is thicker, savorier, and can be used as a pizza, flatbread, or even a
        bed.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Big glass</li>

        <li>A tiny bowl</li>
        <li>A dough separator thingy</li>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water (~100 F),, plus more for rolling</li>
        <li>2 cup AP flour, plus more for rolling</li>
        <li>1 tsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>3 tbsp plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp kalonji (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp fennel seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>Melted butter to brush onto naan (to taste)</li>
        <li>Coarse sea salt to sprinkle onto naan (to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In big glass, dissolve yeast, 1 tsp sugar, and water. Let sit until frothy, about 10 mins.</li>
        <li>While waiting, sift flour, salt, baking powder, and remaining 1 tsp of sugar into big, deep bowl</li>
        <li>When yeast frothy, add yogurt and olive oil, then stir.</li>
        <li>Pour yogurt mixture into dry ingredients and add seeds (if using), then gently mix with fork.</li>
        <li>When dough about to come together, start to knead it in the bowl with clean hands. It will feel like there
            isn't enough flour, but
            keep at it. It'll transform into a soft, slightly sticky, and pliable dough.</li>
        <li>When dough is transformed, cover with plastic wrap or damp towel and let sit in warm, draught-free place for
            2 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Fill the three small bowls and the tiny bowl: one with a little bit of butter (set beside stove), one with a
            little bit of
            water, and one with a little bit of flour; fill the tiny one with coarse sea salt. Take out the
            dough and lay it on a table with the latter two bowls.</li>
        <li>Warm up your pan on high heat. Have a lid nearby.</li>
        <li>Separate the dough into 6 equal portions and lightly roll each one in the bowl of flour to prevent stickage.
        </li>
        <li>Shape the naan. It should be a teardrop shape, about 8 to 9 inches in length, 4 inches in width, and about
            1/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is smoking, dampen your hands and flip the naan in your hands to dampen it. Then, place it on
            the pan gently. Cook for about 1 minute. The dough will bubble. If it doesn't, your naan may be too thick
            and you may burn it.</li>
        <li>Flip the naan. The underside should be black and blistered in spots.</li>
        <li>Cover with lid and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Remove from pan, set aside into flatbread warmer or a plate with damp towel on it to wrap them with. Brush
            with melted butter and sprinkle coarse sea salt.</li>
        <li>Devour naan or use with soup, <a href="curry.html">curry</a>, or a dip.</li>
    </ol>
