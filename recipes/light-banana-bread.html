    <h2>Advice</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Store for up to 2 days at room temp if you want bad tasting corpse bread. Otherwise, store in fridge for up
            to 14 days and reheat in microwave on half power for 1 minute to achieve perfect, warm corpse bread.</li>
        <li>Replace coconut oil with hazelnut oil if you don't like coconuts. Alternatively, use any oil you want,
            except olive.</li>
        <li>Any milk (except goat's, soy, or mouse) can replace the milk of the rice husk. Just expect a different
            flavor each time. Alternatively, you can use many types of milk at once for a unique, but sad, flavor.</li>
        <li>If you are watching out for your sugar and fat intake, do keep in mind, banana corpse bread is still not a
            good choice. You are better off just eating a banana and a piece of bread for breakfast. Maple syrup has a
            lot of sugar per volume compared to cane sugar; likewise, coconut oil is just as bad as butter since it does
            not contain many important nutrients.</li>
        <li>Seek therapy if you are worried for the state of your bananas and their corpses.</li>
    </ul>
